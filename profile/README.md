# Let’s understand what we breathe with Air-o-Walk

Welcome to the Air-o-Walk GitHub organization! We’re happy to have you here. Below you’ll find an overview of our active projects and repositories:

## Description

Air-o-Walk is an organization dedicated to making people aware of the real quality of the air they breathe, supported by people like you. We are building a CloudSensing community that is finally conscious of what they are actually breathing every day.

### Problem Solved

A large number of people are not aware of the true air quality around them. Conventional air quality monitoring stations are usually widely spaced and fail to deliver localized information. This project enables real-time, hyperlocal air quality monitoring, helping individuals make better decisions regarding their outdoor activities and overall health.

### [Android App](https://github.com/Air-o-Walk/android)

This repository contains the development of our Android application, focused on providing innovative solutions for data acquisition and transmission within our platform.

### [Backend Services](https://github.com/Air-o-Walk/server)

Here you will find the main server-side code, responsible for handling data flow and communication between the mobile app, the server, and the database.

### [Web Interface](https://github.com/Air-o-Walk/frontend)
